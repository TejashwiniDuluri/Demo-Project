    <strong>INTRODUCTION</strong>
</p>
<p align="justify">
    Python is a high-level, interpreted, interactive and object-oriented
    scripting language. Python is designed to be highly readable. It uses
    English keywords frequently where as other languages use punctuation, and
    it has fewer syntactical constructions than other languages.
</p>
<p align="justify">
    <strong>Python is Interpreted </strong>
    − Python is processed at runtime by the interpreter. You do not need to
    compile your program before executing it. This is similar to PERL and PHP.
</p>
<p align="justify">
    <strong>Python is Interactive </strong>
    − You can actually sit at a Python prompt and interact with the interpreter
    directly to write your programs.
</p>
<p align="justify">
    <strong>Python is Object-Oriented </strong>
    − Python supports Object-Oriented style or technique of programming that
    encapsulates code within objects.
</p>
<p align="justify">
    <strong>Python is a Beginner's Language </strong>
    − Python is a great language for the beginner-level programmers and
    supports the development of a wide range of applications from simple text
    processing to WWW browsers to games.

    <strong> NUMPY</strong>
</p>
<p align="justify">
    NumPy is a Python package. It stands for 'Numerical Python'. It is a
    library consisting of multidimensional array objects and a collection of
    routines for processing of array.
</p>
<p align="justify">
    Numeric, the ancestor of NumPy, was developed by Jim Hugunin. Another
    package Numarray was also developed, having some additional
    functionalities. In 2005, Travis Oliphant created NumPy package by
    incorporating the features of Numarray into Numeric package. There are many
    contributors to this open source project.

    <li>
        <p align="justify">
            Operations related to linear algebra. NumPy has in-built functions
            for linear algebra and random number generation.

            <strong>NumPy – A Replacement for MatLab</strong>
        </h2>
<p align="justify">
    NumPy is often used along with packages like scipy (Scientific Python) and
    matplotlib<strong> </strong>(plotting library). This combination is widely
    used as a replacement for MatLab, a popular platform for technical
    computing. However, Python alternative to MatLab is now seen as a more
    modern and complete programming language.
</p>
<p align="justify">
    It is open source, which is an added advantage of NumPy.
